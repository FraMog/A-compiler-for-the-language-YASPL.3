# A-compiler-for-the-language-YASPL.3


In this project it has been implemented a compiler for the YASPL.3 language, a simple programming language idealized at the University of Salerno. I used the JFlex utility for the implementation of a lexical analyzer and JavaCup for the implementation of a semantic parser. For further information contact me at francescomogavero@outlook.com
